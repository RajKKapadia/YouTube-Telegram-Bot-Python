# Telegram bot tutprial
Hey everyone, I have developed this repositry so that you can learn how to create your Telegram bot and connect it to Openai GPT-3 and Dall-E 2. This bot will reply to text messages and generate image from text.

### Youtube
I have recorded a quick video on the setup of this chat-bot, in case you want to replicate the work, you can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/zxoco9TfNpw).

### What you will need
There are couple of things that you need before you get started following this repository.
* OpenAI API key, since it is open to all, you can create an account [here](https://openai.com/) and access the key.
* You need a telegram bot API key as well, you can get it with interacting with Botfather on Telegeram [here](). Alternatively, you can one of my video on how to create a Telegram bor [here](https://youtu.be/oBQMPmCVY8c).
* API requesting application like Postman, Insomnia, etc.
* NGROK for local testing.
* Account with GitHub and Render for deployment

### How to use it
To replicate the work of this repository and run it locally, you need to follow these steps:
* create a `.env` file inside the root directory, create these environmental variables:
    ```
